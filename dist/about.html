        <p>Hi! I’m Joe, I am an IT professional with over 13 years of experience. I have recently taken a shine to programming
          and web design and started to self-study. Even though I’m new to this, I have learned a lot and I've been having
          a blast along the way.
          <br>My background in system administration, cyber security and help desk has given me a good foundation in networking
          protocols, system architecture and server setups along with passion for customer support. I feel like my background
          complements me in my current pursuit to be a full stack web developer.
